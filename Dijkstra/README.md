Dijkstra's algorithm

Djikstra's algorithm solves the problem of finding the shortest path from a point in a graph (the source) to a destination. It turns out that one can find the shortest paths from a given source to all points in a graph in the same time, hence this problem is sometimes called the single-source shortest paths problem.

Algorithm

1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.

2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.

3) While sptSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices

   a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSetand has      minimum distance value.


   b) Include u to sptSet.


   c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.

Worst case performance

       O ( |E| + |V|log|V| )
      |V| - number of Vertices
      |E| - number of Edges
